# BoardBuddy
Today any avid boardgame enthusiast knows that there's more boardgames than ever before. Lots of us have enormous collections we can hardly keep track of. BoardBuddy servers two purposes for those users: Organization and Scoring.

## Organization
BoardBuddy allows a user to organize all of their games and suggest new games for the application. BoardBuddy's game database is completely crowd-sourced.

## Scoring
BoardBuddy will suggest what the optimal game in your collection to try is given some factors in a typical game-night scenario such as number of players, time allocated to play, and desired complexity of the game.
